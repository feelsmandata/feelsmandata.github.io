### Project 2
- **Description** : This project appears to be focused on analyzing ride booking data to understand various aspects of the ride-hailing service. This includes:
            Exploring booking trends over time.
            Analyzing booking statuses and identifying reasons for cancellations.
            Identifying popular pickup and drop locations.
            Examining driver and customer ratings.
            Building predictive models, likely to predict booking outcomes or other relevant metrics.
            Overall, the project seems aimed at gaining insights into the ride booking operations to potentially improve service, understand user behavior, and optimize operations.
